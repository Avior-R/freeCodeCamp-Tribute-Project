        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of B.J. Habibie's life:</h3>
        <ul><li><span class="bold">1936</span> - Born in Prepare, Dutch East Indies</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1960</span> - Received an engineer's degree in Germany with the title Diplom-Ingenieur</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1962</span> - In 1962, Habibie returned to Indonesia on sick leave and reconnected with Hasri Ainun. They married on 12 May 1962 and soon after moved to Germany.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1965</span> - delivered his dissertation in aerospace engineering and received the grade of "very good", giving him the title Doktoringenieur (Dr.-Ing.).</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1974</span> - Suharto recruited Habibie to return to Indonesia as part of his drive to industrialize and develop the country. Habibie initially served as a special assistant to Ibnu Sutowo, chief executive officer of the state oil company Pertamina and Chair of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1976</span> - Habibie was made CEO of the new state-owned enterprise <i>Industri Pesawat Terbang Nurtanio</i> (IPTN; Nurtanio Aircraft Industry), which in 1985 changed its name to <i>Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara</i> (Nusantara Aircraft Industry; also abbreviated as IPTN) and is known as Indonesian Aerospace (PT. Dirgantara Indonesia) since 2000.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1978</span> - Appointed as State Minister of Research and Technology (Indonesian: <i>Menteri Negara Riset dan Teknologi, Menristek</i>). He continued to play an important role in IPTN other "strategic" industries in this post.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1980</span> - IPTN had grown considerably, specializing in the manufacture of helicopters and small passenger planes. Under Habibie's leadership, IPTN became a manufacturer of aircraft including Puma helicopters and CASA planes.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1990</span> - While serving in cabinet, Habibie was also elected as the first Chair of the Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI). This modernist Muslim organization provided him with a political base, linked to but independent of the Suharto administration.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1991</span> - Habibie oversaw ten state-owned industries including ship- and train-building, steel, arms, communications, and energy.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1992</span> - In Suharto's regime, as was expected of senior government executives, Habibie became a member of the Golkar organisation. Suharto appointed him as deputy daily coordinator for the chairman of the executive board, and the following year he became the daily coordinator.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1995</span> - IPTN pioneered a small passenger airplane, the N-250 Gatotkaca, but the project was a commercial failure.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1998</span> - After accepting nomination for a seventh term as president, Suharto announced the selection criteria for the nomination of a vice president. Suharto did not mention Habibie by name, but his suggestion that the next vice president should have a mastery of science and technology made it obvious he had Habibie in mind. In that year, in the midst of the Asian Financial Crisis, this suggestion was received badly, causing the rupiah to fall. Despite this, Habibie was elected as vice president in March 1998.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1998</span> - Just two months into Habibie's vice presidency, Suharto announced his resignation. Habibie, as the Constitution says, succeeded him as president. The following day, Habibie announced the Development Reform Cabinet, which removed some of the most controversial ministers in Suharto's last cabinet while maintaining others, with no major figures from the opposition. Within days of his appointment, he asked his relatives to resign from government positions, promised an early election, repealed some legislation, and ordered the release of political prisoners.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1999</span> - At the 1999 MPR General Session in October, Habibie delivered an accountability speech. MPR members then began voting to decide if they would accept or reject his speech. Habibie attempted to win the support of the military by offering the vice-presidency to General Wiranto, but his offer was declined. Tandjung's Golkar faction broke ranks and voted against him, so his accountability speech was rejected by 355 votes to 322 and Habibie withdrew his nomination as president. He was succeeded by Abdurrahman Wahid.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2006</span> - Released a book called <i>Detik-Detik Yang Menentukan: Jalan Panjang Indonesia Menuju Demokrasi</i> (Decisive Moments: Indonesia's Long Road Towards Democracy). The book recalled the events of May 1998 which led to his rise to the presidency. In the book, he controversially accused Lieutenant General Prabowo Subianto, Suharto's son-in-law (at that time) and the Kostrad Commander, of planning a coup d'Ã©tat against him in May 1998.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2019</span> - Dies at the age of 83</li></ul>
